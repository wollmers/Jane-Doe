# NAME

John::Doe - A test distribution using similar file names

# SYNOPSIS

    use Jane::Doe;

# DESCRIPTION

Don't install or use it, except for testing module toolchains.

The distribution has files with non-ASCII filenames under `share/`, UTF-8 encoded, in normalization variants, and confusable variants.

In theory the involved tools should work, but with a high chance they fail.
